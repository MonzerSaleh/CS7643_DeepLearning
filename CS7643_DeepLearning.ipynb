    "This differs from basic programming in that ML creates an algo that can build a model that in turn can receive data and make decisions. Basic programming would require that the program receive the data itself in order to make a decision. The distinction here is that ML programs a learner to perform a task vs performing the task itself. Linear regression is the classic example. We take some data and we produce an equation, that in turn can be used to make predictions. Programming a learner that can create that equation is the machine learning algo's job. \n",

The Y's are generally called our labels (or Ground Truth). In Unsupervised learning we are not given the labels Ys but only the data X itself. In Reinforcement learning we have an agent, an environment, actions and a reward. It's the reward here that best approximates the notion of a label. There's no supervision in reinforcement learning, it might be better to say observed experiences. \n",

    "Supervised learning can be NonParametric Model which have no explicit mathematical formula, examples of this include decision trees and Knn classifiers. They can also be parametric, which have an explicit formula, examples include logistic regression and neural networks. Linear Classifiers fall into the parametric umbrella. These can face challenges though as the number of dimensions increases. "

However scores suffer from some issues. Difficult to interpret, no bounds and hard to compare to other classifiers. To remedy some of these issues we will use the softmax function to turn scores into probabilities.  \n",

    "Note that the loss is 0 if the score for $y_i$, which is the ground truth label, is greater than or equal to the scores of all the other classes, which are incorect, plus one. This will maintain a margin between the score for the ground truth label and all the other possible categories. We want to have a score that is higher by some margin for the ground truth label. When this is not the case we penalize this by how different it is from the margin. To do thie we take the max over all the classes that are not the ground truth, and penalize the model whenever the score for the ground truth itself is not bigger by a particular margin. This is called a hinge loss.    \n",

It will also affect both the forward, and backwards, gradient flows. If you initialize the weights to values that are in some way degenerate (close to a bad local minima) then this will lead to poor gradient flow. If the weights are initialized to be activated into statistically large and these large activations are fed into our nonlinearities (such as the tanh) then the algo will begin in the saturation range of the function. In a similar fashion if you can start in an area s.t. the inputs are small then you be in the linear regime or close to it in the nonlinear space, and you will have a strong gradient to learn from. Of course if you can start near a good local minima then that will be beneficial as well. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let us now move beyond classification to other tasks such as object detection and segmentation. So far our classification tasks involve feeding many images into a neural network. NN then extracts features and uses these to classify it with a score that is fed into a softmax function to give us an output probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "What may not be apparent is that so far our images are dominanted by an object of a single class. In fact the CNNs we've looked at so far depend on this characteristic. So how do we perform tasks when this doesn't hold true? For example semantic segmentation tasks require us to parse multiple object from a single image (road,buildings, cars, sky). In this situation we might want a probability distribution for each pixel in an image, and for each class. This would then give us the ability to distinguish between pixels belonging to a car vs say the road. In this type of task we care little about multiple instances, that situation is covered later. What about object? In this situation we want to identify an area (aka bounding box) with a class distribution for the box/category. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image we want to output another image, where the output contains a class distribution per pixel. This is what's generally considered an image-to-image problem. There is an input tensor (C,H,W) which should output (D,H,W) where D represents the class, but the height and width remain the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a considerable leap from our previous work with CNNs. Generally a CNN downsamples the image, using the convolutional layers and pooling functions, to create a feature map. This reduces the dimensions to the necassary features which it then uses to classify the image. So how do we upsample an image, after it's been reduced to extract it's features? Another problem we need to tackle is that Fully connected layers, like those at the end of a CNN, ignore spatial information, and throw it away. We need to keep this type of information for a segmentation type of task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea is to simply disregard the linear layers. In fact we can simply replace them with even more convolutions! This is true because, as you might recall, convolutions are linear operators! If you need the math just remember that a fully connected layer is given by Wx+b, so we can represent the Wx by a convolution that simply outputs the dot product scalar value. In this type of situation each kernel can be thought of as outputting a single node (the scalar output). We can of course do this for other layers as well, not just the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically the representation of a fully connected layer or a convolutional layer where the kernel is the same size as the input is equivalent. And so it begs the question why might be we want to perform this trick? As it turns out that this will allow us to be no longer dependent on a particular input size, and it turns out this is useful for segmentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose that we have an original input size here of a 5x5 image, and we have a kernel (3x3) that we've learned, this will result in an output of size 3x3. If we place a fully connected layer after this, or after we've converted it into a fully connected layer, we'll have a kernel that's exactly the size of the output. And so we'll have a fully convolutional layer kernel that's dot producted with the input to produce one output node in the fully connected, or convolutional, layer. Then we can have multiple of these if we want multiple output nodes. It turns out that if we feed it a larger input, as we know it, since it's normal convultion, the output map at the last convolutional layer will be bigger, because as you recall the convolution operation is defined by the striding operation, in kernel size matters none. Hence, if we retain the same convolutional layer as before. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we move past fully connected layers, and convolutions. Now we begin looking at richer structures like sequences, graphs. we'll see that the notion of attention will be important, which is looking at sequences of things (or graphs) where you have many nodes and elements and you need to determine their importance. Eventually we will look at combining computer vision and sequencial learning to jointly process both of these modalities together, by using them as building blocks together in a greater computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have focused on Fully connected layers, and convolutional layers. In both cases the goal is to sufficiently load high dimensional structures we can process into lower dimensions that make it possible to extract meaningful hidden representations in the form of vectors for fully connected layers and then make our prediction. The reason we did this is to add architectural biases such that we can learn better and faster with less data. At the end of the day any network with sufficient depth and mild assumptions can learn any function. So it really comes down to how much data is needed and how fast can it be done. \n",

    "These are just a few examples that have been written about. RNNs were the first to be written about. They contain a state vector that encodes all previous encounters. So to process a sentence it must keep a vector of all words it has come \n",
    "across, ie read, before. The next word should trigger an update of the vector (state). This addresses the limitations of a fully connected layer which requires the data to be of fixed dimensions. RNNs will keep their vector size fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all their merits RNNs also have some disadvantages such as optimizing a long sequence (such as thousands) of elements. As we backpropogate through a long sequence the gradients may get smaller and smaller, or even larger and larger leading to vanishing and exploding gradients. Another issue is that backprop through a single vector is somewhat challenging. for example: when dealing with a documents with thousands of words. At any point in time we would need a vector that can represent all the words we have seen so far, like at the very beginning, while at the same time processing the last few paragraphs of the document. You have to propogate all the information necassary at any point in time across the entire sequential structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attention based systems are designed to remedy the memory problem. Rather than try to remember every thing in a document up to the current point, it will just have a vector that represents each element (for example each word) in the document as well as a weighting mechanism that will update with each new occurance. Think of a softmax function which gives a probability distribution of all the words encountered so far. \n",

    "While many of these were developed for sequential data it need not be limited. These can be generalized. Softmax for example doesn't require the elements to be ordered. These notions can be thought of as a graph composed nodes and edges. Nodes have a vector representing some features. Then we can combine this across the graph where we refine the features of each node, using not just it's local features but also the features of it's neighborhood. So now for any node we can get the refined features that are the local features as well as the weighted sum of the neighborhood features, this can then be used to update that feature.  \n",

In a standard feed forward neural network a single data set (an image or observation) is given a network in order to get a prediction. In an RNN data is fed one element at a time, so for example each word in a sentence is given one at a time, and after each input the RNN is formulating a response that takes into account the previous elements.

The gradient of the input layer is the product of the gradient of the subsequent layers. If these gradients are small then the gradient of the input layer, which is the product of very small values, will also be very very very small. This results in very small updates to the weights and thus learning is severly diminished. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this sections we introduce the concept of structured representation. Unlike CNNs with very specific connectivity biases we will try to develop architectures that can learn some of these structured representations explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will revisit the principles of building and optimizing feed forward networks and generalize them to any arbitrary computation graphs. As it turns out the algo for backprop simply needs some tweaking for sequential data. Recall that when we began we spoke at length of acyclic graphs and their ability to be modularized into any shape or number of components needed by a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that one of the central drivers of Convolutional networks was the need to develop architectural biases to represent the things we know to be true. Such as stationarity, features that can appear anywhere in and image. Using this approach we also showed that it was able to learn compositional feature space. That is low level features such as edges or textures or colours mid-level features such as corners and edges, and higher level features such as objects and parts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we want to follow the same pattern of adding architectural biases, so can represent arbitrary items or elements and not just pixels and windows. Compositional structures are not limited to images, here are some more examples from other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Composition\n",
    "- VISION: Pixels->Edges->Texton->Motif->Part->object\n",
    "- SPEECH: Sample->Spectral Band->Formant->Motif->Phone->word\n",
    "- NLP: Character->word->NP/VP->Clause->Sentence->Story\n",
    "\n",
    "We may go even further in asking if we can create a more general mechanism that can automatically learn these relationships. The structures that we want to model may represent relationships between elements (ie \"Man on top of horse in front of a mountain\"). These represent yet another dimension, and we would need to model the spatial relationship between them. this can also take the form of relationships between words in a sentence, or elements in a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structures may go even higher yet. For example we may want to represent all concepts in the world, such as a graph of all pages in wikipedia. Current architectures simply cannot begin to represent higher level structures. Graphs are simply a more general way of looking at these structures. We can have embeddings or vectors, for each node. (NB Embeddings are a learned map from entities to vectors of numbers that encode similarity). Once we create an embedding map we can represent it as a graph where the nodes are feature vectors and the edges represent some sort of connectivity, or similarity, typically. This allows us to find all the inputs for a particular node. There can be multiple types of edges to represent different relationships such as (on top, or below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Embedding** Optimize the objective that connected nodes have more similar embeddings than unconnected nodes via gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "When representing structured information, several things are important:\n",
    "- State: Compactly representing all the data we have processed thus far\n",
    "- Neighborhoods: What other elements to incorporate?\n",
    "    - Can be seen as selecting from a set of elements\n",
    "    - Typically done with some similarity measure or attention\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_04.png\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly in language problems we will encounter the same concepts. Here we will use an attention mechanism on a flat linear structure. Attention is an extremely powerful concept. It allows to represent some arbitrarily set of information of any size. Softmax can also be applied to any size set. Then you can use the results to weight and combine information. This process can be applied to any sequential type of structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_03.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment now to formalize these concepts. we begin by looking at a simple example that nicely ties back to the ideas found in CNNs we have discussed already. recall that we developed convolution layers because it did not make sense to connect an output pixel to all input pixels across a high dimensional image or feature map. This was because we know that we will want to extract low level local features, which does not require a network tied to each single pixel but rather to an area.  \n",

    "This module introduces the concept of masked language modelling, a concept that has been used very effectively in NLP to improve the performance in a variety of tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the language model probability of a sentence we've used in previous sections\n",
    "$$P(s)=P(w_1,\\cdots,w_n)=\\prod_i P(w_i | w_{i-1},\\cdots,w_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Masked Language Modeling** is a related **Pre-training task** - an auxiliary task, different from the final task we're targetting, but which can help us achieve better performance by finding good initial parameters for the model. In a manner of speaking it's similar to a training signal of sorts or even a feature, it is helpful in the final task. By pretraining on masked language modelling before training on our final task it is possible to obtain higher performance than by simply training on the final task alone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Masked language models take a sequence of words as inputs, to which they augment special symbols to mark the start and end of a sequence of words. This is the same as in any language model. They will also cover up, or mask, some of the original words with special tokens. We then take the word embeddings corresponding to these words and we feed them into a transformer encoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since transformer encoders have no inherent notion of position of their inputs, and this is useful for language, we will also add to the input some special positional embeddings. This may strike you as a bit of hack, but the fact is in practice it tends to work rather well. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_15.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The final task here is to predict what the masked words are. Although this is a strange and artificial task, it is quite difficult. A model that can learn to do this well has learned a great deal about language, as well as some of what we call common sense knowledge. Now when this model is trained to perform some task which we do care about, the model will not only learn to perform the new task, but it will also retain part of the knowledge to perform masked language modelling. This gives the model a significant boost in performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a token level task - such as classification. Optical Character Recognition involves identifying which input tokens identify entities such as persons, dates, locations, and so on. Here we might input a sentence without any masked tokens. For the outputs we would train the network to perform the correct classification, which would be the entities we're looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example  \n",
    "- Sam    -> PERSON\n",
    "- was    -> null\n",
    "- born   -> null\n",
    "- in     -> null\n",
    "- 1972   -> DATE\n",
    "- in     -> null\n",
    "- Toronto-> LOCATION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sentence level task where we are interested in learning the global meaning of a sentence, such as sentence classification. Conventionally here we might take the first output of the transformer encoder at the top layer and use that to classify the sentence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be done to translate sentences\n",
    "- english: I am hungry\n",
    "- french: J'ai faim \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_16.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will learn to look at the two translations simultaneously in order to better predict what the masked words are. A model pretrained with cross lingual masked lanuage modelling can be used in the same way as a model with normal masked language modelling. But the real strength of these models comes from the cross lingual transfer. Image we took such a model and trained it to perform classification using english training data. Because of the cross lingual nature of it's pre training task, this model should now be able to perform classification in other languages as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular task is **Cross-Lingual NLP Inference**. Given two sentences a, and b, the task is to decide whether the first implies the second, or whether it contradicts it, or whether the two sentences are unrelated. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_17.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly enough this will also work on French data, despite not being trained directly on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This class of models, which are all based on pre-trained transformers, have proven revolutionary in the field of NLP. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_18.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as you can see in the illustration above, as the transformer based models have led to an incredible boost in performance, often even beating the human baseline, they are also getting incredibly large!\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach to dealing with incredibly large models is knowledge distillation, which can reduce the size without  significantly impacting the preformance. In this scenario we use two models: A pretrained teacher model and a smaller student model. The teacher model will be much larger, and more complex. We feed the input data into both models and we will obtain two predictions. We will then compute two loss metrics: **distillation loss** as the difference between the student pdiction and the teachers prediction, **Student loss** as the difference between the student's prediction and the target or ground truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_19.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick here is to encourage the student to align it's predictions to those of the teacher as well as the target. Why this works is still a topic research. It's not fully understood. One idea is that in using \"soft predictions\" the student model will try to align it's probability distribution to that of the teacher. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD3_20.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even take this a step further. You can take any unlabelled text and use the teacher to make predictions on it. This can then be used to augment the training for the student.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine how we might implement such a distillation loss.  \n",
    "- Recall our cross entropy loss from earlier \n",
    "    - $\\large H(p*,p)=-\\sum_{x \\in X} p*(x) log(p(x))$\n",
    "    - where p* is our reference distribution\n",
    "    - the minimum of this loss occurs when the two distribution are the same\n",
    "    - so it is for this reason that it is often used as a loss function for distillation\n",
    "- Let t be the distribution of the teacher model, and s be the distribution of the student\n",
    "    - then $\\large \\mathcal{L}_{distillation} = H(t,s)=-\\sum_i t_i log(s_i)$\n",
    "- The student loss is simply a cross entropy classification loss\n",
    "    - $\\large \\mathcal{L}_{student}=H(y,s) = -\\sum_i y_i log(s_i)$\n",
    "- Finally the total loss is simply a linear combination of them\n",
    "    - $\\large \\mathcal{L} = \\alpha \\mathcal{L}_{distillation} + \\beta \\mathcal{L}_{student}$\n",

    "#### 3.16.01 Translation at Facebook \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me talk a little bit about how we empower the experience of translation of user content. \n",
    "- first We have a language identification module that runs for every single piece of text that is produced at Facebook and it assigns it a score. Language score basically the most likely language that this piece of text is in. \n",
    "- second, we have a user language model that tells us what are the likely languages a certain user understands. And this is based on the history on how much they communicate in a certain language or how much they consume content in a certain language.\n",
    "    - here's the tricky part when we detect that a certain user understand the content, because it's in a different language, we provide the option to see translation.\n",
    "    - this is where this little button \"See Translation\" comes into play. By clicking it a user is accessing the translation in their language of preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.16.02 Challenge: Low Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenge 1 - social media text can be short, error prone, noisy, make little sense, uses hashtags, \n",
    "    - use of emerging language such as slang can be overly difficult\n",
    "    \n",
    "Traditional Deep Learning Language models are based on classical statistical methods and work well on standardized languages like english, french, spanish. However since 2016 there has been a shift to Neural Machine translation **(NMT)** models and these require an even greater amount of data than the traditional DL models. They perform better then dl methods but also consume much more resources in order to overcome the DL benchmarks. Again they do well on standard languages. For non standard languages it becomes much more difficult due in part to the lack language data. Consider how much more english data there is on the internet vs say \"Njerep\". (Njerep is spoken by approx 4 people in Nigeria and faces extincion in the very near future)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenge 2 - Language Similarity  \n",
    "    - In order to train a model well you generally need a large number of equivalent pairs, which again faces similar issues as before. \n",
    "- Challenge 3 - Language Domain\n",
    "    - To complicate matters even more the domain becomes highly relevant. So even if we have some availability of data, it is quite possible that is not in the right domain, is not geared towards our needs. For ex a model trained on news feeds is unlikely to perform well for people looking to get traffic details in another language. \n",
    "- Challenge 4 - Evaluation    \n",
    "    - So for many of the language parents that we will like to improve, we don't have access to a real test set. It is often emulated by ablating or reducing high resource language pairs which they do not correct to represent the reality of a low resource situation. And this is one of the main blockers to improve the development of research in the low resource area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate properly we needes to have very strong benchmark data sets that allow us to advance the state of the art. And to do so, we really worked on having datasets that are representative of the real low resource problem. We did this for Nepali-English, very different language, first in Sinhala-English. We called this the **FLORES** data set and we'll now explain what it consisted of. \n",

    "One technique that was employed to great success was Multilingual Training. This is when you might use a translation in language with a high similarity to the target language. ie Belarsian and Ukrainian are highly similar in alphabet, vocab and grammer. Ideally one of these languages should be language rich. This supports transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique that has been used quite extensively is back translation. This same supervised technique allows us to leverage large quantities of monolingual data, which we then use to train a larger model. This works very well for languages like German and English, and has helped to bring equality to a level that has won several translation competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have some small amount of training data say from German to English, you train the small model, German to English, you then use to annotate large quantities of German data into fake English data, or translated English data. And now, you use this pair, you reverse the order and you use it in conjunction to your previous data. So now you can train a better English to German system."

    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll talk about advanced topics, that is we'll show the power of deep learning and moving beyond just the standard supervised machine learning setting that we've talked about thus far. For example, we'll try to address the problem of how to deal with unlabeled data, which is much easier to collect. And where we don't have a lot of labeled data, that is annotations that humans have made or given for each piece of data that we have. We'll also try to cover decision making tasks,\n",
    "which moves beyond just making predictions on pieces of data. But actually allows the neural network to make the decisions in the form of actions that actually affect the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This far, we've only dealt with supervised learning, where for each piece of data that the neural network processes we have a ground truth annotation or label, that is what the answer should be. This allows the neural network to update its parameters.\n",
    "This can be quite limiting in some situation. For example, it's much easier to collect unlabeled data, that is collections of data where we don't know what's in it. Maybe even a combination, a small amount of labeled data, but a very large amount of unlabeled data. For example, scraped across the internet. Similarly, we may also try a decision making task, where our predictions are actually actions in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, playing a games such as chess. In a game we may make many such predictions and go through the entire game, and we don't really have labels for each point in the game, or what we should have done. All we know at the end is whether we won or lost. This is what's called sparse supervision, where you don't really have an answer for every point in time, or for every piece of data that the neural network processes. It's also a little bit of a different type of supervision, rather than the answer of what we should have done, what predictions we should have made. All we have is a reward, whether we've done well or not well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that really, we can use a lot of the fundamental building blocks that we've used thus far. Except change some aspects of this, such as incorporating different types of loss functions for example. Let's look at these in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **supervised learning**, we have a training dataset consisting of xs and ys.  And we're trying to do is learn through function approximation, a very complex nonlinear function represented through a neural network that map's x to y.\n",
    "- In **unsupervised learning**, on the other hand, we don't have any label y, all we have is the input data x. And really all we're trying to do is learn some model of the joint distribution over the input space. For example, what do natural images look like? What is the joint probability distribution over the pixels that represents natural images?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that these classical methods don't really deal with, is the feature learning part. As we've learned, the key thing that makes deep learning successful is that we're able to automatically optimize the feature space given the inputs. And specifically in supervised learning, we're optimizing the features so that we can make the best predictions on the labels. However, you can try to think about ways to learn features using just unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning** on the other hand, deals with evaluative feedback in the form of reward. So here the supervision is no longer for each piece of data, what should the predictions have been? Really, you have this cycle where you have an environment such as a chessboard, you make some action that changes the environment. And then you could go through the cycle many, many times. And only at the end you get some sort of reward that tells you whether you've won or lost. In some cases you can get some reward in the middle too. For example, playing an Atari game you get some score throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world it's difficult to get labeled data, because it's both costly and time consuming to pay people to annotate them. However, it's much easier to get unlabeled data. For example, we can just take videos across the world or crawl the internet for images and pieces of text and other data that already exists. And so there's a range of machine learning settings that people have developed and looked at that goes beyond supervised learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 01 Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce reinforcement learning where the task is to make a sequence of decisions or predictions similar to what you're seeing in sequence models. However, we will not receive supervision in the form of the correct decision or a prediction which should have been made. Instead, we will only receive evaluative feedback in the form of reward for the decision or our prediction which was made. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition** Reinforcement learning can be defined in one sentence as a sequential decision, making in an environment with evaluative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break the last sentence into it's component parts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment**   \n",
    "Let's break this definition down by first talking about what we mean by an environment. For that, let's imagine we have an agent who can take actions in an environment and the environment produces a state which the agent can persist. In addition to giving a reward to the agent for the actions it did take. Now this environment may be unknown, very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_01.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the worst case as a real robot being deployed in the world, in which case the environment is the real world.\n",
    "The task of this agent is to learn a policy to map states of the environment to actions that it can play to affect the environment. The objective of this agent is to maximize the reward it will get from the environment in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluative feedback**    \n",
    "Evaluative feedback means that the agent is supposed to pick actions and receive rewards which can be positive or negative only for the actions that it did take and not for the actions that did not take. This means that the agent will never know or have supervision for the correct or best action that it should have taken at a particular state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential decisions**    \n",
    "Unlike supervised learning, and sequential decisions just means that the agent needs to make a sequence of actions or a sequence of states in order to complete the task. And with this what can happen is that the reward may be delayed and\n",
    "it can only happen at the end of the task, which means that the agent needs to optimize in the long term for rewards it may get at a very very later stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges** With these definitions, let us look at the signature challenges.   \n",
    "- To evaluate a feedback implies that the best action can only be found through trial and error, requiring the agent to try all possible actions at all states. \n",
    "- In order to be 100% certain about the best action, the agent may not receive reward for every action it takes, requiring long term planning in order to eventually get high rewards in the future. \n",
    "- Updates made to the policy during learning will lead to changes in the actions that are picked by the policy and hence will change the data distribution of states and rewards that the policy absorbs making this distribution non stationary. \n",
    "- Further, if the task involves streaming data, the agent will see certain states only once and never again in his lifetime, making it difficult to learn from past mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the protocol for how the agent interacts with the environment.    \n",
    "At every time step t   \n",
    "- the agent will receive an observation $o_t$ \n",
    "- it will execute an action $a_t$ \n",

    "- the environment will receive this action $a_t$ \n",
    "- and produce a new observation $o_{t+1}$, as well as a reward $r_{t+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RL has also been applied to games like GO where the objective is to defeat the opponent. \n",
    "- The state of the environment is the location of the pieces on the board.\n",
    "- The action is where to put down the next piece and\n",
    "- the reward in this case is quite sparse.\n",

In which case the agent right now is at (2,3). The actions that the agent can take is either move one cell north, east, south, or west.

However, let's assume that there is some noise in how the agent transitions to next state. This noise is in the form of a 20% chance, of the agent drifting once a left or right of the direction of motion. Now, things get a bit complicated. The policy will now have to prescribe an action, for the states that the agent could land up in. As it is not guaranteed to always move in the direction of east. One way to describe such a policy, would be in the form of a 2D matrix, of the same shape as this 2D grid. But each matrix element is prescribing an action to take, if the agent is at that cell.

Thus far, we've really looked at supervised learning where we have a large labeled data set X and associated labels Y, typically coming from human annotation. In deep learning, we wanna learn a function that maps from X to Y, typically as a conditional probability, the probability of the label given the data. However, annotation of data is costly, both in terms of time as well as monetary cost. This is because you have to pay people in order to annotate manually each example and this can really add up if you have hundreds of thousands, or millions of examples. So we may want to consider machine learning settings where we assume that have much less labeled data.\n",

What we wanna do is learn models and feature representations that will generalize or transfer to a new set of categories where we only have 1 to 5 examples per category.\n",

    "A very simple idea is to learn/train a model on labeled data, make predictions on unlabeled data, then add back into the training data. This can be repeated as often as is necessary. Another approach is to combine unlabeled and labelled data and perform co-training predictions across multiple views. In this method we generally use augmented data techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a recent algorithm called FixMatch(https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685). Which has proven extremely effective in the Semi-Supervised Learning context. There are several ways to instantiate this idea. There would be two stages where we train the supervised model on the label data. And then we apply that model on unlabeled data. Obtain pseudo-labels for those predictions that are confident, feed those back into the training set. Again, we'll retrain the supervised model.\n",

    "The beauty of deep-learning is that we don't actually have to do this in multiple stages. We can have this entire pipeline trained in an end to end manner. Specifically, we can have the mini batch consist of both labeled and unlabeled examples. For the labeled part of the mini batch, it goes through the traditional pipeline. We'll extract features, make predictions and then use cross-entropy loss because we have ground truth labels annotated by humans. For the unlabeled examples, we'll apply two types of augmentations. Again do feature extraction and prediction. And then use the predictions obtained on the weakly augmented labeled data, not in its own loss functions, but really as ground truth for the loss from the strongly augmented data. At the bottom right we can see what the loss function looks for the unlabeled part. We'll have a batch size B, for example, 64 examples for the labelled part. And then we'll have a multiplication factor here, for example 7. So our unlabeled mini batch size will actually be much larger than the labeled part. Finally, we just sum up the loss function and averages. And our specific loss function will include the cross-entropy loss H, between the pseudo-label Q hat B and our predictions from the strongly augmented data QB. And then we'll also have this indicator function, which looks like a 1, that only applies this to the predictions that have some greater than a threshold prediction.\n",

Given this bottleneck features, we'll perform a decoding step, we'll perform a reconstruction task. That is, we'll just try to reconstruct the input. This may seem strange, we already have the input,\n",

    "\n",
    "Another thing we can leverage is the clustering assumption. This is common in unsupervised learning, where we assume that high density regions form clusters, that is items or instances that are similar form groups or clumps in some feature space. While low density region, that is regions where there's not a lot of examples separate clusters, which hold semantic meaning.\n",

    "We'd like them to essentially have features that are similar to similar items and features that are far apart, according to some distance metric or elements that are different. And so, this is what we're hoping, we're hoping that essentially whatever original feature space or raw input space we feed.Once we've output feature space that's transformed using a deep neural network, we'd like that feature space to have this property. One thing that we can test this property with is apply K-Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot of these tasks have already existed before deep learning, for example, reconstruction is an optimization criteria for principal component analysis. And clustering has long existed before deep learning, we can actually generalize this idea into the concept of surrogate tasks. That is we'd like to come up with tasks where we can get the answer or label for free in order to drive optimization and prevent the need for human annotation. These tasks though, must also force the neural network to learn effective feature representation. And we'd like to engineer the tasks so that there aren't any trivial solutions or ways that the neural network can cheat to prevent it from learning effective feature representation. It turns out that over the years, a large number of such tasks have been devised, and they all have different characteristics in terms of how effective the features that are learned are. And this can differ both in terms of the level at which the neural network learns features.\n",

    "For example, low-level edge features versus high-level semantic features, as well as how well they can generalize to other tasks as well. One example is colorization. Given a red, green, blue three channel image, we can actually just convert it to grayscale. This can be done using a hard coded formula. And the input to a neural network will then be this grayscale image. And we'd like it to re-colorize the image. Now clearly, this forces the neural network to have to understand something about what is in the image. Otherwise it's really hard to colorize. For example, if you don't know that this is a fish or what type of fish it is or if you have other objects such as tennis balls and so on, it's going to be really hard to apply the same color. And what's nice is that we know the answer, we already have the original RGB image. So we can have the neural network predicts the colorized image and we can use for example, a mean squared error loss function to drive feature learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a specific way that we evaluate the results of these surrogate tasks. Specifically, what we'd like to do is answer the question how good are the feature representations that we learn in an unsupervised manner and how well do they generalize to new label tasks. And so what we typically do is just take the encoder part, for example in the rotation prediction, we don't actually care about the layer that actually predicts the rotation amount. And then we transfer it to the actual task. This is essentially transfer learning where we use it to initialize the model of another supervised learning task. And we really use what we learned in an unsupervised way to extract features such that we can add another classifier on top, typically a neural network or prior machine learning methods such as support vector machines. Often we limit the classifier to simple linear layers. This is because we're interested in how good are the feature representations that we learn and how generalizable are they. So if we're comparing many different surrogate tasks with each other, we don't wanna have another confounding effect\n",
    "by adding additional complex transformations or nonlinearity. That wouldn't essentially tell us how good or the feature representations, but it kind of adds the additional element of training those additional layers. So typically we just take the features from the unsupervised surrogate tasks and then add a linear layer to whatever supervised classification task we'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there's a large number of surrogate tasks and variations that we can use to learn really good feature representations using unlabeled data alone. This includes contrast of losses which work across image patches or context or instance discrimination. And there's many different types of loss functions or training regimes that we can apply some of them more efficient than others. The two that have become dominant and extremely effective are for unsupervised learning. Contrastive losses and when we have semi supervised learning, pseudo labeling losses, where we have essentially the learned model applied to the labeled data, making predictions on the unlabeled data and that gets used to drive a cross entropy loss.\n",
    "You can also use soft knowledge distillation where you don't make the prediction of one hot for the pseudo-label. And I haven't covered all of these methods but a lot of these methods work and  it's not clear which one is the best currently.\n",
    "What we do know is that data augmentation is now key.\n",
    "These methods are used across almost all of these unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning methods.\n",
    "And maybe unfortunately, methods tend to be sensitive to the choice of data augmentation.\n",
    "So there's a lot of recent work exploring how we can automatically learn data\n",
    "augmentation or be able to figure out at least, what data augmentation to use.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll talk about a different class of unsupervised learning methods called generative modeling.\n",
    "Here we take a probabilistic view of unsupervised learning and try to estimate the probability distribution over the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, there's a whole host of different tasks we may want to do. In this lesson, we'll focus on Density Estimation, that is producing a model of the probability distribution over the input space. In some cases, we may want to just have the ability to generate samples from this distribution, that is actually generate artificial examples that come from this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the distinction between Discriminative and Generative models:\n",
    "- **Discriminative models**, model the conditional distribution probability of the label given the input. Examples of this include neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and so on. You may not have known that this is actually what we're doing, because really we just approximate this probability distribution using a blackbox neural network. We haven't done any additional probabilistic reasoning. However, if you've taken a machine learning course, you may have learned that there's an entire probabilistic and statistical view of machine learning. Where we can actually write out these probability distributions and reason about them. For example, to derive what loss functions we may want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative models**, on the other hand, models the distribution over the input space. Now, this is a very complex distribution, and so there's a question of how we can actually model it. Just, like discriminative models we can have a parametric approximation of this distribution. That is we can have a set of parameterized models p(x,theta). And use the principle of maximum likelihood to optimize the parameters given the unlabeled data set. Here p(x,theta) is our likelihood and we wanna maximize it or are real theta, that is we want our model to output high probabilities for the real deta. We can use this as the optimal set of parameters, data star, being the argmax data of the product of the likelihood of each example. This is because the examples are drawn independently and identically, that is we're just sampling independently from this distribution. And so the likelihoods of all of the data can be decomposed as the product of the likelihood of each piece of data. We can then take the log of this because we're maximizing it, and this turns out into a sum of log likelihoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are called generative models because they can often generate samples. Once, we have some parameters data, we can also generate examples from this distribution that we're approximating. Some examples include multi-variate Gaussian model, where we have mu and sigma, that is the mean and co-variants. And what we wanna do is estimate these values from the data, and then given these estimates, we can just sample from the multi-variate Gaussian to actually produce example. Now, of course, this is very difficult, especially for high dimensional data. Because generative modeling is so difficult,\n",
    "there's been a whole host of different methods that have been developed. These can be categorized in various ways, for example, whether they use the maximum likelihood principle in order to optimize their parameters. There are methods that perform explicit tractable density estimation. That is, they simplify the joint distribution into some factorized model consisting of simpler components and then learn parameters for those. There are methods that perform approximations of various kinds, that is, they learn distributions that approximate the true joint distribution. And then there are implicit density models,\n",
    "where we don't actually model the density itself. Rather, we're just able to perform tasks such as sampling from the density. That is we can generate samples from the probability distribution, but we can't really have an explicit model for it that we learned. We'll cover the three most popular methods across the spectrum, in order to give you a flavor of all the different methods that exist.\n"

    "In the context of language modeling, this should be familiar. Rather than modeling the joint distribution over all words in a sentence, we can just factorize it, and here we have a natural sequence or ordering because the words come in a word at a time.\n",
    "And so we can model the probability of the sentence as the product of the conditionals, the probability of the first word, the probability of the second word given the first word and so on.

    "we're updating our model to be better and better at modeling this conditional distribution p(xi) given the prior pixels.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_26.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll talk about a different class of generative models called generative adversarial networks. Generative adversarial networks or GANS did not learn an explicit density function p of x, rather they fit under the implicit density category. What that means is rather than learn a parameterised density function We will instead learn a parameterised generation process that can give us samples from the joint distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't have an explicit density though, to perform things like classification or things like that. But we'll still be able to use the unlabeled data to learn how to generate new samples. That fits that distribution of the unlabeled data, or even learn features that might be good for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to learn how to sample from a neural network output. It's not clear how to produce random outputs. Given some fixed input thus far, we've only dealt with a particular input and then generate a particular output. We also will use the notion of adversarial training. We'll use one that works predictions to train another networks, lost function. This is essentially can be seen as a dynamic loss function and you have two neural networks learning at the same time that we will pit against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also lots of tricks to make this more stable. Because you have a game theoretic optimization pitting two neural networks against each other, the complex dynamics of learning will actually turn out to be quite difficult to train. And so there's a lot of different tricks that researchers have developed in order to make this more stable and effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we would like to sample from a very complex distribution p(x) using a neural network. We're going to use a simple idea of first sampling from a simple distribution, they a Gaussian, where we know how to generate samples from, and then we'll actually learn a transformation function that transforms samples from that simple distribution to samples from the complex distribution. Here's an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_27.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this transformation function can be pretty complex, but that's okay. We have deep learning where we can learn really complex functions as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concrete instantiation of this idea: \n",
    "- Suppose we sample from a Gaussian many different times to generate a vector of independently generated random numbers\n",
    "- then we take this vector and use a generator that is a network that takes a vector and up samples into an image \n",
    "- or transforms it into an image through a complex set of convolutions and spooling layers \n",
    "- then it outputs a complete image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of generative adversarial networks is to have another network that distinguishes between real and generated or fake images. And the reason we wanna do this is that how well the discriminator performs, can be used as a signal to determine how well the generator is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_28.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the discriminator is supposed to output a probability of one for the real image and zero for the fake image. And so if d of g of z should be zero, because it's a fake image, then we want one minus d of g of z. And then we take the log of that.\n",
    "And so this is essentially saying how well does this discriminator going to do?\n",
    "And the generator wants to minimize this because the generator wants to fool the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, this right side of the objective function is saying how well is the discriminator doing on fake data and generator wants to minimize that because it wants the discriminator to not do well. Note that the objective function for the generator only is affected by the right side. That is the gradients for the first part of the term of the objective function is zero. Because if you notice it only has log of D of x and there's no term there that depends on G. So no amount of changing G parameters will affect that part of the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_29.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the discriminator is doing the opposite. We can sample from the fake data and the discriminator wants to maximize this, how well the discriminator does, that is, it wants to output zero for the fake data. At the same time we sample a mini-max from the real and again the discriminator is maximizing this Note that for the generator, only one part of this objective function is valid. On the left side of the objective, we just have [log of D(x)]. That is the discriminator output on real data. And nothing we change about the generator's parameters effects this part of the objective That is a gradient zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "So really the gradient for the generator only comes from the right side of the term, whereas the gradients for the discriminator comes from both. It wants to both do well on the real as well as on the fake in discriminating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_30.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall however the generator's wants to minimize\n",
    "- 1-D(G(z)) will be pushed down to 0 while D(G(z)) will be lifted to 1\n",
    "    - this means that it is taking fake data and giving it a probability of being real as 1\n",
    "- This means that the generator is fooling the discriminator\n",
    "    - ie succeeding at generating images that the discriminator can't discriminate from real\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, we'll update the generator using the gradients from this objective. So we're tuning both the generation process and the feature extraction in order to essentially output more and more realistic images. Here is a visual depiction of the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_31.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we'll have a mini batch of real and fake data, we'll have the generator producing the fake data, where we start from a vector of random numbers, where each random number in the vector is sampled from a normal distribution. And then we'll also have in the mini batch real images. And we'll feed those discriminator, and each part will have an objective, the generators objective only touches the 1-D(G(z)), because that's the only part of the objective that has G in it. And we're going to average this over the mini batch, that is over the fake data in the mini batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator loss on the other hand, includes both of the terms it wants to both make sure that it outputs a high probability for the real data and a low probability for the fake data. And so we'll perform backprop and average the gradients over the entire mini batch. And it turns out that the generators part of the objective is actually not very good in terms of its gradient property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the full algorithm.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_32.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that GANs weren't as good in the early days is that training these mini-max objective functions are just intrinsically hard. You have all sorts of strange dynamics that can occur between the generator and discriminator. So a number of advancements have been developed, including more stable architectures, regularization methods to improve the optimization, and things like progressive growing, that is learning a generative model for small images and smaller networks. And then slowly scaling those up and reusing the learning from the smaller networks to the larger ones, or just scaling these two very large hyperparameter models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the early innovations that occurred in GANs is just tuning the architectures, it turns out that different architectures are more stable than others for training this objective. This is from a paper called DC GANs where several findings were developed. For example, replacing pooling layers with strided convolution, using batchnorm both in the generator and discriminator, removing the fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures. Using ReLUs except for certain places such as the output, or using LeakyReLU activations for the discriminator. Again, it's not clear why these things in particular help but through empirical investigation, researchers found it to be a good solution for stable GAN training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, training GANs is difficult due to the mini-max objective. You can actually have all sorts of strange dynamics of the training, for example, what if the generator just learns to memorize and output samples of your training? This actually will do really well, it'll fool the discriminator because it can't tell those real samples. The problem is you don't have a lot of diversity or variety, you're not truly sampling from the distribution, you're just outputting the samples that you already have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is only generating parts of the distribution, so you can do really well, for example, on male faces or only on female faces, but not both. There's something called mode collapse where you can't capture all the modes of the distribution. There are several regularization methods that were developed and these are typically theoretically motivated.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not going to go through the entire library of regularization method since there are dozens at this point, but some really simple ones, for example, just add noise to the real images. It turns out that this can actually be theoretically-motivated and derived, as researchers improved all of these aspects that is, architectures, objectives, and optimization and regularization methods, as well as scaling. Researchers began to be able to generate extremely realistic images. In fact, these images that you see here are not real they're fake, and you can actually see that it's not that easy to tell them apart from real images, there are some details that are often wrong. For example, eyes are hard, especially making both eyes be consistent with a gate or in appearance, however, overall, these actually have pretty good details, which is quite surprising. Just like language models however, they're not without failures, you can have, for example, different types of class confusion that occurs where the generator confuses different types of classes together, such as a tennis ball or in some animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are kind of comical failures but what's interesting is that they're not that bad, we can understand that this is a failure mode that's rather reasonable. It turns out we can also generate videos that are consistent across time, this shows those are really interesting use case, you should check out the YouTube video link here. What this is showing is images from videos that are completely generated. What the researchers did is take videos from professional dancers and extracted their body pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then take as input a 10 second footage of you moving around randomly, and then the GAN is able to automatically generate an entire video of you dancing like the professional dancer. This is quite cool and has some implications for things like bias and misinformation but check out the video, I think you'll like it. In summary, generative adversarial networks can produce amazing images and videos and these days other adaptations have been developed to produce audio waveforms and so on.\n",
    "They still have some drawbacks, high-fidelity generation is pretty heavy to train and requires a lot of compute, training can be unstable, so A lot of experience and research is needed to make it stable. At the end, we don't actually have an explicit model for the distribution P(x), and so if you wanna do things like classification, it's not clear how to directly take what's learned, really, we just take the features and then fine-tune them. There's a large number of extensions ranging from GANs conditioned on labelled data or other information if it's available. And the notion of adversarial losses, for example, a discriminator that discriminates between real or fake, or one data set to another data set are actually useful in a number of different domains and have been used successfully.\n"

    "    - Decoder gives us $p_{\\theta}(x|z)$ so we can compute an estimate of the term through sampling \n",

    "    - This KL term (between gaussians for encoder and z prior) has nice closed-form solution\n",
    "- Term 3 : $D_{KL}(q_{\\theta}(z|x^{(i)})||p_{\\theta}(z|x^{(i)}))$    \n",
    "    - We cannot compute this as $p_{\\theta}(z|x)$ is intractable as we saw earlier\n",
    "    - but we do know that the KL must be greater than or equal to 0 so this will suffice\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't compute term 3, so what we're going to do is do basically just ignore it.\n",
    "We know that KL divergence is always greater or equal to zero.\n",
    "And so if we just maximize the first two terms here,\n",
    "we know that we'll still be making progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something called the variational lower bound or \"ELBO\".\n",
    "And it's actually a powerful technique that's used in many different places.\n",
    "The key idea is that if you are able to compute parts of your objective, that is\n",
    "a lower bound where the terms that you're ignoring are greater or equal to zero.\n",
    "Then you can just maximize those terms and still make progress towards this objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's summarize how we can train our variational autoencoder. We'll have a mini batch of unlabeled data x, and we'll run it through our encoder. $Q(Z|X;\\phi)$ this will be used to output parameters of a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "Again, this is an assumption we make mu z and sigma z.\n",
    "And so we're going to make the approximate Posterior distribution close to the prior.\n",
    "That is we're going to take the KL divergence between Q of z given x,\n",
    "which is what we're computing here, and P of z.\n",
    "Again this can be assumed to be a normal distribution, let's say with a mean of\n",
    "zero and standard deviation of one for example, and this is a KL divergence\n",
    "between two Gaussian distributions which actually can be computed in closed form.\n",
    "We can then sample from this and generate a bunch of Z.\n",
    "And then we feed it through our decoder, which feeds it through\n",
    "P of X given Z with parameters theta and generates mu X and sigma X.\n",
    "And now we can essentially maximize the likelihood of the original data being reconstructed.\n",
    "That is we're going to maximize the log p of x given z,\n",
    "which is what our decoder is computing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we can put it all together in a single picture:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_40.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize the likelihood and \n",
    "we compute the likelihood to be these terms again.\n",
    "There's an extra term that we ignored because we're performing the lower bound optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We showed the forward propagation, but one problem is that we are trying to back propagate through a sampling function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we take the z given X and try to sample from the mu z and sigma Z, we're performing some sampling operation, and then we try to feed it through the decoder and then we want to generate some exes or parameters for exes. And then we have a loss function that we compute from there. But then we wanna back propagate through this entire thing all the way back to the original encoder. The problem is you can't actually back propagate through sampling. It's non differentiable. So there's something called a reparameterization trick, which allows you to do the sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_41.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we need to differentiate through sampling process with respect to $\\phi$ our encoder, which is probabilistic. The way we solve this is by moving the sampling part out of the part of the computation graph that has to go all the way back to the encoder. Specifically, we're going to make the random this independent of the encoder output. We'll sample from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and identity covariance matrix. And then we'll essentially take that output which we call epsilon here and multiply it by the sigma and then add it to the mu, the mean. And so rather than sampling from an of N of mu gamma sigma, we're sampling from N of zero gamma identity and then we're also taking that output that we sample and multiplying it with the sigma that the encoder output. Then we add it back to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MOD4_42.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "But the key idea is that using this trick allows us to have a computation graph where if we back propagate all the way back to the encoder, it doesn't go through the sampling process. The sampling process, as you can see here is actually out of the way of the path that we actually need. And so you can actually use variational autoencoders in order to again generate samples. And what you can do is you can actually at the end, take the decoder and then try to feed it in different random Z's, again sampled from a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance for example. And then try to actually sample multiple Z and try to see how well these samples look.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do what's called walking the latent space, that is you can take a Z1 that is one dimension of your latent space Z2, which is another dimension, and then you can actually interpolate between them. So rather than sample the Z's, you could just take for example, for z one, all values from zero to one via some interpolation in between and similarly to Z2, and then take those values and generate the samples for each of those. And what you can see is some smoothness in the dimensionality of the Z. That is, if you take 21, it seems to correspond something to do with smiles. For example, if 21 is at the top, you have a frown face, whereas if 21 is at the bottom value, a low value for 21 then you have smiling. For Z2 you can see perhaps something different being encoded such as orientation of the face. You can see that the left of the x axis tends to be the one orientation, \n",
    "whereas the right side of the space for Z2 is a different orientation. And you see a nice smooth interpolation between these. And you can see some similar things for training in this ten written digit data set. And so it is actually learning some disentangled space where each dimension of your latent space is representing some sort of attribute independently. And we can actually generate samples for what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary variational autoencoders provide a principled way to perform approximate, maximum likelihood optimization. We have a bunch of assumptions, for example, that the prior distribution over Z is normally distributed with some hand-coded mean and standard deviation. And we also assume that the encoder and decoder both output parameters of Gaussian distribution. However, given those assumptions, we can then derive what the log likelihood terms can be. And we can actually perform a maximization of that log likelihood. Albeit it's an approximation because there are some terms that we can't compute and so we ignore. \n",
    "\n",
    "The samples from VAEs are actually not that competitive with GANs, they tend to be blurry. However, the latent space that it tends to learn in an unsupervised way are actually pretty effective for downstream tasks. One example, is this cool reference on world models that is learning latent features, given some input from a game, for example, images of a game, and we can then learn the dynamics of that latent space. For example, how the latent space evolves over time as you play the game. And this is essentially a simulator that you learned, also known as a world model. And you can actually perform reinforcement learning within the simulator that you learned rather than actually having to gather real world experience in the game. This is just one example.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots of other examples of downstream tasks that use the latent features which are nicely disentangled in many cases and pretty effective."
